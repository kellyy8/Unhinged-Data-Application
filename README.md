# Unhinged Dating Application
I constructed a radix tree to develop a program with an object-oriented design that matches members with those who meet their minimum number of compatible attributes. 

# Getting started:
### Step 1. Install the software.
Install [Xcode 14.2 or newer](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode).  

### Step 2.
Download all the files into one local folder.

### Step 3.
Open the file ```Unhinged.xcodeproj``` in Xcode.

### Step 4. Update the directory pathway for the Derived Data.
In main.cpp, in lines 12-13, update the string variables, ```MEMBER_FILE``` and ```TRANSLATOR_FILE```, to the directory pathways for the files ```members.txt``` and ```translator.txt```, respectively.

### Step 5.
Run the project code in Xcode.  
Allow Xcode to access the folder it requests permission for.

### Step 6. 
To retrieve matches, enter an email from the ```member.txt``` database and a minimum number of compatible attributes.
